## Overview

### The challenge

Frontend Mentor has a series of challenges that give you designs (or in this case, just screenshots) for websites, and your task is to implement them. This is one of their "newbie" level tasks -- the primary goal is just to come up with something that switches between the desired full screen and narrow views. As they put it:

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

This is a plain vanilla implementation -- it uses absolute and relative positionining and basic media queries to switch between stylesheets for wide and small screens.

### What I learned

I've found this to be helpful. I'm currently taking a Udemy full stack web dev course that is quite good, but it can't cover everything and some of the exercises are a bit too hand hold-y, so this was a nice way to get some slightly more realistic practice. It was a good project to get bakc into the basics of HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

I plan to use the next project I work on as an opportunity to get more practice with the flex layout.
